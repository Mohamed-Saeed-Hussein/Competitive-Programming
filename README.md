Welcome to my personal repository for competitive programming. This collection serves as a comprehensive library of algorithms, data structures, and utility templates that I utilize for contests and practice. The code is written in C++17, focusing on performance, readability, and ease of integration.

## 📂 Contents

The repository is organized by topic to facilitate quick access during contests:

- **Bitwise/**: Efficient bit manipulation techniques and bitmask snippets.
- **Data Structure/**: Implementations of essential data structures including:
    - Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
    - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
    - Segment Tree & Persistent Segment Tree
    - Mo's Algorithm
    - Sparse Table
    - MEX (Minimum Excluded) utilities
- **Math and Number Theory/**: A robust collection of mathematical algorithms:
    - Combinatorics & Matrix Exponentiation
    - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    - Modular Arithmetic & Number Theory helpers
    - Big Integer support (`__int128`)
- **Strings/**: Advanced string processing algorithms:
    - KMP Algorithm
    - Z-Function
    - Aho–Corasick
    - Rolling Hash
    - Trie
- **Templates/**: Ready-to-use contest templates, fast I/O snippets, and policy-based data structures.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each file is designed to be a standalone C++ source file, making it easy to copy and paste into your solution.

### Compilation

To compile a single file using `g++` (recommended for contests), use the following command:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pipe -static -s path\to\file.cpp -o file.exe
.\file.exe
```

**Notes:**
- Remove `-static` if you encounter linking issues on your platform.
- Omit `-s` during local development to retain debug symbols.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an optimization or a new algorithm to add:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Commit your changes with clear messages.
4. Open a pull request describing your addition.

Please ensure your code is well-commented and follows the existing style.
